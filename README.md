Final project for Nina Perone, Kira Thomas, and Sydney Jacob (Freshmen Sec 001)

Instead of our original power up of allowing the snake to move over itself, we decided to make the snake slower for a few seconds. Additionally, instead of using images for the snake's head and body, we spent our time adding a title screen, rules screen, and ending screen. We had the most touble with figuring out how to use a time in Python to slow down the snake for a specific amount of time, but we eventually figured it out. We most enjoyed making a game because we could demo it as we went along and had fun playing it while working.
